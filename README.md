# Play API SDK

**pyht** is a Python SDK for [Play's AI Text-to-Speech API](https://play.ht/text-to-speech-api/). Play builds conversational voice AI models for realtime use cases. With **pyht**, you can easily convert text into high-quality audio streams with humanlike voices.

Currently the library supports only streaming and non-streaming text-to-speech. For the full set of functionalities provided by the Play API such as [Voice Cloning](https://docs.play.ht/reference/api-create-instant-voice-clone), see the [Play docs](https://docs.play.ht/reference/api-getting-started)

## Features

- Stream text-to-speech in real-time, synchronous or asynchronous.
- Generate non-streaming text-to-speech, synchronous or asynchronous.
- Use Play's pre-built voices or your own custom voice clones.
- Stream text from LLM, and generate audio stream in real-time.
- Supports WAV, MP3, Mulaw, FLAC, and OGG audio formats as well as raw audio.
- Supports 8KHz, 16KHz, 24KHz, 44.1KHz and 48KHz sample rates.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `aiohttp`
- `filelock`
- `grpc`
- `requests`
- `websockets`

## Installation

You can install the **pyht** SDK using pip:

```shell
pip install pyht
```

## Usage

You can use the **pyht** SDK by creating a `Client` instance and calling its `tts` method. Here's a simple example:

```python
from pyht import Client
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pyht.client import TTSOptions
import os
load_dotenv()

client = Client(
    user_id=os.getenv("PLAY_HT_USER_ID"),
    api_key=os.getenv("PLAY_HT_API_KEY"),
)
options = TTSOptions(voice="s3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/775ae416-49bb-4fb6-bd45-740f205d20a1/jennifersaad/manifest.json")
for chunk in client.tts("Hi, I'm Jennifer from Play. How can I help you today?", options):
    # do something with the audio chunk
    print(type(chunk))
```

It is also possible to stream text instead of submitting it as a string all at once:

```python
for chunk in client.stream_tts_input(some_iterable_text_stream, options):
    # do something with the audio chunk
    print(type(chunk))
```

An asyncio version of the client is also available:

```python
from pyht import AsyncClient

client = AsyncClient(
    user_id=os.getenv("PLAY_HT_USER_ID"),
    api_key=os.getenv("PLAY_HT_API_KEY"),
)
options = TTSOptions(voice="s3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/775ae416-49bb-4fb6-bd45-740f205d20a1/jennifersaad/manifest.json")
async for chunk in client.tts("Hi, I'm Jennifer from Play. How can I help you today?", options):
    # do something with the audio chunk
    print(type(chunk))
```

The `tts` method takes the following arguments:

- `text`: The text to be converted to speech; a string or list of strings.
- `options`: The options to use for the TTS request; a `TTSOptions` object [(see below)](#ttsoptions).
- `voice_engine`: The voice engine to use for the TTS request; a string (default `Play3.0-mini-http`).
    - `PlayDialog-*`: Our large, expressive English model, which also supports multi-turn two-speaker dialogues.
        - `PlayDialog-http`: Streaming and non-streaming audio over HTTP.
        - `PlayDialog-ws`: Streaming audio over WebSockets.
    - `PlayDialogMultilingual-*`: Our large, expressive multilingual model, which also supports multi-turn two-speaker dialogues.
        - `PlayDialogMultilingual-http`: Streaming and non-streaming audio over HTTP.
        - `PlayDialogMultilingual-ws`: Streaming audio over WebSockets.
    - `Play3.0-mini-*`: Our small, fast multilingual model.
        - `Play3.0-mini-http`: Streaming and non-streaming audio over HTTP.
        - `Play3.0-mini-ws`: Streaming audio over WebSockets.

    - `PlayHT2.0-turbo`: Our legacy English-only model, streaming audio over gRPC.
- `streaming`: Whether or not to stream the audio in chunks (default True); non-streaming is only enabled for HTTP endpoints.

## Command-Line Demo

You can run the provided [demo](https://github.com/playht/pyht/tree/master/demo/) from the command line.

**Note:** This demo depends on the following packages:

```shell
pip install numpy soundfile
```

```shell
python demo/main.py --user $PLAY_HT_USER_ID --key $PLAY_HT_API_KEY --text "Hello from Play!"
```

To run with the asyncio client, use the `--async` flag:

```shell
python demo/main.py --user $PLAY_HT_USER_ID --key $PLAY_HT_API_KEY --text "Hello from Play!" --async
```

To run with the HTTP API, which uses our latest Play3.0-mini model, use the `--http` flag:

```shell
python demo/main.py --user $PLAY_HT_USER_ID --key $PLAY_HT_API_KEY --text "Hello from Play!" --http
```

To run with the WebSockets API, which also uses our latest Play3.0-mini model, use the `--ws` flag:

```shell
python demo/main.py --user $PLAY_HT_USER_ID --key $PLAY_HT_API_KEY --text "Hello from Play!" --ws
```

The HTTP and WebSockets APIs can also be used with the async client:

```shell
python demo/main.py --user $PLAY_HT_USER_ID --key $PLAY_HT_API_KEY --text "Hello from Play!" --http --async
python demo/main.py --user $PLAY_HT_USER_ID --key $PLAY_HT_API_KEY --text "Hello from Play!" --ws --async
```

Alternatively, you can run the demo in interactive mode:

```shell
python demo/main.py --user $PLAY_HT_USER_ID --key $PLAY_HT_API_KEY --interactive
```

In interactive mode, you can input text lines to generate and play audio on-the-fly. An empty line will exit the interactive session.
